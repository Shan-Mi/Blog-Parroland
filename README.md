# HTML-CSS-uppdrag1
This is the first assignment for HTML/CSS course. It is a blog about parrot, here sticky nav is used and it is a responsive design.
Very simple and basic attempertation.
Here I used the outdated clearfix layout, and in the next coming assignments I learned about how to use modern flex/grid layout which are really cool.
